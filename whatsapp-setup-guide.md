# WhatsApp Customer Confirmation Setup

## How It Works Now

When a customer makes a booking, the system will **automatically**:

1. ✅ **Process the payment** (test mode working now)
2. ✅ **Generate unique booking ID** (e.g., SPT1G2H3K4L5M)
3. ✅ **Save booking to database** (when Firestore is enabled)
4. ✅ **Auto-send WhatsApp confirmation** to customer's mobile number
5. ✅ **You get booking info** through admin panel at `/admin-access-sptp2024`
